{"ALG_DESC": "Spatial inequality based on decomposition of Theil statistics.\n\nDecomposes attribute variation (inequality) into inequality between observations within regions (intraregional inequality) and inequality between observations from different regions (interregional inequality).\n\nUses random spatial permutations of attribute values across spatial units to test for the siginficance of the observed interregional inequality component. The pseudo-p value that is reported is the proportion of the  the maps from the random permutations that generated interregional inequality components larger than the one for the original map.\n\nSee: http://www.pysal.org/library/inequality/theil.html", "ALG_CREATOR": "Sergio Rey", "attribute": "Variable for which inequality will be measured", "ALG_VERSION": "1.0", "ALG_HELP_CREATOR": "Sergio Rey", "input": "Layer", "null": "", "regime": "Attribute that defines exhaustive and mutually exclusive partioning of features"}
